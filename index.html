                <div class="article-content">
                    <p><strong>BURIED CITY</strong> A local has been forcibly removed from a chimney this morning after
                        attempting to "interrogate" a flock of pigeons regarding the whereabouts of his missing rubber
                        duck.
                    </p>

                    <p>The incident follows the recent influx of avian activity in the Buried City ruins, due to their
                        migration fueled by the recent defrosting of their breeding grounds.
                    </p>

                    <p>Journalists at The Speranza Gazette conducted various interviews with the local residents.
                    </p>

                    <p>"You see them up there, nesting in the chimneys? They aren't laying eggs, they’re charging their
                        batteries” Affirms the local, “I saw one pick up some Wasp Controllers and fly it straight to a
                        rooftop. You think that's for a nest? Of course not! They are disguised ARC drones!"
                    </p>

                    <p>The influx of birds has led to a surge in Raider activity on the city’s rooftops, with many
                        Raiders installing new ziplines to easily reach the rooftops. However, the increased number of
                        ziplines has also led to more frequent encounters with flying ARCs and rival Raiders.
                    </p>

                    <p>"The rooftops used to be really quiet" says one veteran Raider, “Now it’s a chaotic mess of
                        ziplines, birds, and people screaming about pigeons stealing their loot. I saw a man lose a
                        Queen Core to a seagull; he didn't even fight back, he just watched it fly away in silence… Who
                        the fuck brings a Queen Core to a raid?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Council has issued a formal reminder that birds are biological organisms and do not possess
                        hardware nor spying capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the time of press, the birds have refused to comment, though several were seen staring
                        intensely at a Raider’s shiny level four Anvil with what can only be described as "tactical
                        intent”.
