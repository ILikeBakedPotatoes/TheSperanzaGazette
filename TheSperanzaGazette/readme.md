## The speranza gazette

Look, first time doing some github shi, idk how to do it and I had to google loads of info, but I think I did it correctly lmao.

As I said in the index.html "This is a fan-made satire website. THE SPERANZA GAZETTE is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by Embark Studios. ARC Raiders and all associated assets, logos, and lore are the property of Embark Studios. This site is for entertainment and parody purposes only.

I don't take any money from this, hell, even I don't know if I need to spend money to do this, I'm a newbie lol.

So, this is the readme file, please embark studios don't sue me, I'm poor, a Cease and Desist would work just fine.

Anyways, ILoveBakedPotatoes out.
