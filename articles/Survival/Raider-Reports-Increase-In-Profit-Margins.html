                <h1 class="headline">RAIDER REPORTS 300% INCREASE IN PROFIT MARGINS AFTER SQUAD MASSACRE</h1>
                <p class="caption">Survivor denies rumors of sociopathy, claiming he is simply "mathematically gifted"
                    in a way his former squad was not.</p>

                <p><strong>BLUE GATE</strong> While most survivors return from an ARC Queen encounter needing intensive
                    psychological therapy and a new pair of underwear and pants, local Raider "Looter" Lenny returned to
                    the Docks yesterday afternoon with a glowing smile from side to side and a backpack so heavy it
                    almost snapped the elevator cable.
                </p>

                <p>Lenny's squad, "The <s>Three</s> Lone Musketeer<s>s</s>" was reportedly cornered by the ARC
                    Queen behind a small boulder near Blue Gate's Checkpoint. While initial reports suggest the rock
                    provided "Adequate tactical cover for all of them", Lenny pushed their
                    teammates out of the boulder's protection.
                </p>

                <p>When asked about the reason behind his actions, Lenny replied, "Have you ever tried to hide three
                    people behind one rock? It’s cluttered. It’s messy. It’s "Old World" thinking. I’m leaning into a
                    minimalist lifestyle now".
                </p>

                <p class="image-caption">A candid shot of two of "The Three Musketeers" transitioning into a
                    decentralized, higher entropy gaseous state.
                </p>

                <p>Lenny’s trek back to the extraction lift was described as <em>"peaceful"</em> and <em>"unburdened by
                        useless chatter"</em>. <em>"For the first time in my career, I could peacefully walk without
                        having to hear Sarah complain about her "aching knees" or Mike asking for a "medical adrenaline
                        shot".</em>
                </p>


                <p><em>"It was quiet,"</em> Lenny remarked, with a bright smile on his face. <em>"The only sound was the
                        wind, the distant whistle of an ARC drone, and the sweet clinking of six Queen
                        Reactors and seven Magnetic Accelerators in my backpack. That's the sound of success. I'm sure
                        you can't hear that when your teammates are screaming for help; that's why I never bring a
                        defib to my raids."</em>
                </p>

                <p>Following the announcement of the Mayor's new <b><a href="../Politics/Speranza-Mayor-New-Decree.html"
                            class="headline-link">"Elevator Maintenance Fee"</a></b> decree, Lenny was reportedly seen
                    at the central ventilation shaft attempting to argue that the extra 80kg in his backpack was
                    <em>"strictly emotional baggage"</em>.
                </p>

                <p>The news has affected the Speranza social scene. At the local bar, "The Rusty Bolt"
                    several squads were seen sitting in awkward silence, with members carefully measuring the width of
                    their teammates' shoulders against the nearest piece of cover.
