                <p class="caption">After six years and 42 million credits, Speranza top researchers finally deciphered
                    the "highly sophisticated" firmware driving the ARC Tick. </p>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p><strong>SPERANZA</strong> In what is being called "The most significant breaktrough since the
                        invention of the Anvil pistol", Speranza's top researchers have finally breached the encription
                        of the firmware driving a captured ARC Tick.
                    </p>

                    <p>For years, the researchers have speculated on the deep, neural-network-driven logic that allows
                        Ticks to coordinate their movements and execute high-precision ambushes on unsuspecting Raiders
                        on the worst possible timing.
                    </p>

                    <p>Late last night, lead researcher Lizzy released the decrypted "Source Code" to a stunned (and
                        slightly confused) public. The code is as follows:
                    </p>

                    <p class="image-caption">The decrypted "Source Code" of the ARC Tick.</p>

                    <p><em>"We were expecting layers of sub-routines, ethical sub-processors, perhaps even a sense of
                            self-preservation,"</em> Lizzy told the Gazette while staring blankly at a wall, as if the
                        work she has done for the past 6 years has concluded in the most anticlimactic way possible.
                        <em>"We spent three years trying to bypass the encryption on the "tick_high_level_ai()" function
                            alone, thinking it included a highly advanced AI protocol. Spoiler alert, it was not. We
                            also found out that the audio file that the ARC plays once it spots a target is actually
                            named "Scare_them_lmfao.mp3"</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Reactions at the docks have been less than enthusiastic. <em>"They spent millions to read that
                            shitty code? I figured that shit out the first time a Tick took off my left boot. If the
                            Mayor wants to pay me a million credits, I can leak the firmware for the ARC Queen,
                            too. Goes like this probably, if raider detected, shoot big fucking laser. Send the check to
                            my locker."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>"It’s all about knowing our enemy,"</em> Mayor Hallowell defended in a press release this
                        morning. <em>"Before this discovery, we suspected they wanted to kill us. Now, we know they want
                            to kill us. That is the kind of tactical certainty that keeps Speranza safe. Also, as Sun
                            Tzu once said, "Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in
                            peril." In my opinion, the 42 million credits were spent for the good of all Speranza."</em>
